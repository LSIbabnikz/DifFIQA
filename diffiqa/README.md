## __1. Environment Setup__

__Before running training or inference you also need to obtain the pretrained model weights for the used FR model.__

- The weights for the CosFace model used in the paper are available at the [official repository](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/recognition/arcface_torch). 

- The correct backbone is available under the __glint360k\_cosface\_r100\_fp16\_0.1__ directory.

- Place the file under __./model_weights__ and rename it to _"weights.pth"_.


---



## __2. Training__

__To train the DifFIQA diffusion approach first configure the training configuration file *./configs/train_config.yaml*.__

- Alter the folder name (_trainin_params.folder_) where the training images can be found.
> The official implementaion uses the CelebA dataset to train the model, but other datasets can easily be used.

- Alter the results folder to where you want to save the results of trainig.

- You are free to alter also the rest of the provided configuration parameters, at your own risk.

__Once you have configured the parameters run the training script.__

> python train.py -c ./configs/train_config.yaml

---


## __3. Inference__

__To perform quality score inference you will need to either train your own diffusion model as described [above](#2-training) or download the pretrained model used in the paper, as described [below](#4-model-weights).__

__Once you have a pretrained diffusion model you can alter the inference script ./configs/inference_config.yaml.__

- Alter the image folder location (_images\_loc_) to point to the dataset for which you want to extract quality scores.

- Alter the model location (_model\_loc_) to point to the pretrained weights of the diffusion model.

- Alter the save location (_save\_loc_) to the location where you want to save the extracted quality scores.

__Additionally, if you did not train your own model, you also need to alter the training script ./configs/train_config.yaml.__

- Alter the image folder location (_trainer_params.folder_) to point to the inference dataset.

__Once you have configured the parameters run the inference script.__

> python inference.py -c ./configs/inference_config.yaml

## __4. Model Weights__

__We provide the pretrained diffusion model weights used in the paper [here](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/zb4290_student_uni-lj_si/EbL6taR4MjxMhkxJEc59SJgBid5iG8J95CJmmt6CR1w5lA?e=feXRA0).__

- Download the provided weights and copy them into ./model_weights.

- Configure the inference file to use the downloaded weights.

- Run the inference as described [above](#3-inference).
